## âœ¨ Simple-Async-Context
TC39 - Async Context for JavaScript

## ðŸ’¼ How to install?

```sh
$ npm i simple-async-context
```
```sh
$ yarn add simple-async-context
```

## ðŸ’ª Motivation
Async/await syntax improved in ergonomics of writing asynchronous JS. 
It allows developers to think of asynchronous code in terms of synchronous code. 
The behavior of the event loop executing the code remains the same as in a promise chain. 
However, passing code through the event loop loses implicit information from the call site. 

And knowing the call is call site of a function is crutial for a variety of purposes. For example, it allows for: 
- attribution of side effects in a software
- tracing tools to provide useful information among other things. 

That's why the feature and this polyfill are usefull ðŸ™ƒ.

## ðŸ“š How To Use?
An example is worth a thousand words, please check the code below ðŸ«¡

```tsx
import { AsyncContext } from 'simple-async-context';

const context = new AsyncContext.Variable();

const wait = (timeout: number) => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, timeout));
const randomTimeout = () => Math.random() * 1000;

async function main() {

  context.get(); // => 'top'

  await wait(randomTimeout());

  context.run("A", () => {
    context.get(); // => 'A'

    setTimeout(() => {
      context.get(); // => 'A'
    }, randomTimeout());

    context.run("B", async () => { // contexts can be nested.
      await wait(randomTimeout());

      context.get(); // => 'B'


      context.get(); // => 'B'  // contexts are restored 

      setTimeout(() => {
        context.get(); // => 'B'
      }, randomTimeout());
    });


    context.run("C", async () => { // contexts can be nested.
      await wait(randomTimeout());

      context.get(); // => 'C'

      await wait(randomTimeout());

      context.get(); // => 'C' 

      setTimeout(() => {
        context.get(); // => 'C'
      }, randomTimeout());
    });

  });

  await wait(randomTimeout());

  context.get(); // => 'top'
}

context.run("top", main);

```
